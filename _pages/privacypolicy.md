# Privacy Policy

LiveFin (“we,” “our,” or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information from users (“you”) of the LiveFin app, available on the Apple App Store.

## 1. Information We Collect

LiveFin is a client for connecting to your self-hosted Jellyfin server. We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information on our servers.

However, the app may access and temporarily use the following data for core functionality:

### a. Information You Provide
- Server Connection Details: When you manually enter your Jellyfin server URL and login credentials, this information is stored locally on your device to allow future connections.
- Device Name and ID: Used to register your device with your Jellyfin server. This information is not transmitted to any third-party services.

### b. Automatically Collected Data
- App Activity: We may use Apple-provided analytics (if you’ve opted in) to understand general app usage patterns (e.g., crashes, time spent in app).
- Error Logs: In case of crashes, we may collect anonymous diagnostic data to improve app stability.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your data only for the following purposes:
- To connect you to your Jellyfin server.
- To improve app functionality and performance.
- To remember your preferences locally on your device.

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties.

## 3. Data Storage and Security
- All connection and authentication information is stored securely on your device.
- No user data is stored or processed on external servers controlled by LiveFin.
- LiveFin uses standard iOS security features like Keychain and secure storage APIs.

## 4. Third-Party Services

LiveFin relies solely on your Jellyfin server to deliver content. We do not integrate with third-party tracking SDKs, ad services, or analytics providers outside of Apple’s optional system-level analytics.

## 5. Children’s Privacy

LiveFin does not collect any data from children under the age of 13. 

## 6. Your Rights and Choices

You can:
- Delete app data by removing the app from your device.
- Clear saved credentials.
- Opt-out of Apple’s system analytics via your device settings.
